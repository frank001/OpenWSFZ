## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ABI self-test on first load

On the first call that triggers `NativeLibrary.Load`, `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL invoke a sentinel function (`ft8_lib_version_check`) that returns a known integer constant embedded at compile time in the shim. The expected constant SHALL be `20260002` (updated from `20260001` to reflect the removal of the R6 weak-signal SNR post-correction). If the returned value does not match the expected constant, `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` with a message that names the library path and the mismatched version values. This requirement applies on all three reference platforms.

#### Scenario: Correct library passes the ABI self-test

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads the platform-appropriate `libft8` binary compiled from the committed shim source at `FT8_SHIM_VERSION = 20260002`
- **THEN** the version check SHALL pass silently and decode calls SHALL proceed normally

#### Scenario: Wrong library fails fast with a clear error

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads a `libft8` binary that returns an unexpected version constant (e.g. the pre-fix value `20260001`)
- **THEN** `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` before any decode call is attempted, with a message identifying the library path and the version mismatch

---

### Requirement: Native library binaries are committed for all three reference platforms

Pre-compiled native library binaries, built from the committed `ft8_shim.c` + `kgoba/ft8_lib` submodule at the pinned commit, SHALL be committed for all three reference platforms:

| Platform | Path | Declared in csproj |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `src/OpenWSFZ.Ft8/Native/win-x64/libft8.dll` | `<Content CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" Link="libft8.dll" />` |
| Linux x64 | `src/OpenWSFZ.Ft8/Native/linux-x64/libft8.so` | `<Content CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" Link="libft8.so" />` |
| macOS ARM64 | `src/OpenWSFZ.Ft8/Native/osx-arm64/libft8.dylib` | `<Content CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" Link="libft8.dylib" />` |

A companion `libft8.version.txt` SHALL record, for each platform binary: source commit SHA, compiler toolchain and version, build date, and SNR formula. The SNR formula entry SHALL read: `SNR: max-over-8-tones estimator, no post-correction (R6 correction removed)`. `BUILD.md` SHALL document the exact compiler commands required to reproduce each binary, with the SNR field mapping updated to reflect that the R6 weak-signal correction is no longer applied.

#### Scenario: All three binaries are present in the test output directory after build

- **WHEN** `dotnet build -c Release` is run on any of the three reference platforms
- **THEN** the platform-appropriate native library file SHALL be present in `tests/OpenWSFZ.Ft8.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/` alongside the test assembly

#### Scenario: The platform-appropriate binary is present in the daemon publish output

- **WHEN** `dotnet publish -c Release -r <rid>` is run for `OpenWSFZ.Daemon`
- **THEN** the platform-appropriate native library file SHALL be present in the publish output directory alongside the daemon executable
