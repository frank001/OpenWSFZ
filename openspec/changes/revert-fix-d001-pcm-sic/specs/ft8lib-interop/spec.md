## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ABI self-test on first load

On the first call that triggers `NativeLibrary.Load`, `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL invoke a sentinel function (`ft8_lib_version_check`) that returns a known integer constant embedded at compile time in the shim. The expected constant SHALL be **`20260002`** (reverted from `20260003`; the two-pass spectrogram-suppression shim without PCM-domain SIC). If the returned value does not match the expected constant, `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` with a message that names the library path and the mismatched version values. This requirement applies on all three reference platforms.

#### Scenario: Correct library passes the ABI self-test

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads the platform-appropriate `libft8` binary compiled from the committed shim source at `FT8_SHIM_VERSION = 20260002`
- **THEN** the version check SHALL pass silently and decode calls SHALL proceed normally

#### Scenario: SIC library (20260003) fails fast with a clear error

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads a `libft8` binary compiled at version `20260003` (PCM-domain SIC, now reverted)
- **THEN** `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` before any decode call is attempted, with a message identifying the library path and the version mismatch

---

### Requirement: Per-pass decode counts are accessible from managed code

`Ft8LibInterop` SHALL expose a method `GetLastPassCounts(int maxPasses)` that calls the native `ft8_get_last_pass_counts` function via P/Invoke and returns a managed `int[]` of length equal to the number of passes actually executed (**now 2**). The managed constant `MaxDecodePasses` SHALL be **2**.

#### Scenario: GetLastPassCounts returns correct two-pass breakdown

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop.DecodeAll` is called and then `GetLastPassCounts(2)` is called on the same thread
- **THEN** `GetLastPassCounts` SHALL return an array of length **2** whose sum equals the total number of decoded messages returned by `DecodeAll`

#### Scenario: GetLastPassCounts returns zeros for a silent buffer

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop.DecodeAll` is called with a silent buffer (0 decodes) and then `GetLastPassCounts(2)` is called
- **THEN** `GetLastPassCounts` SHALL return `[0, 0]`

---

### Requirement: Native library binaries are committed for all three reference platforms

Pre-compiled native library binaries, built from the committed `ft8_shim.c` + `kgoba/ft8_lib` submodule at the pinned commit, SHALL be committed for all three reference platforms:

| Platform | Path | Declared in csproj |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `src/OpenWSFZ.Ft8/Native/win-x64/libft8.dll` | `<Content CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" Link="libft8.dll" />` |
| Linux x64 | `src/OpenWSFZ.Ft8/Native/linux-x64/libft8.so` | `<Content CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" Link="libft8.so" />` |
| macOS ARM64 | `src/OpenWSFZ.Ft8/Native/osx-arm64/libft8.dylib` | `<Content CopyToOutputDirectory="Always" Link="libft8.dylib" />` |

A companion `libft8.version.txt` SHALL record, for each platform binary: source commit SHA, compiler toolchain and version, build date, SNR formula, and the pass count (**2**). `BUILD.md` SHALL document the exact compiler commands required to reproduce each binary. The binaries SHALL be built from the **`FT8_SHIM_VERSION = 20260002`** shim that implements two-pass spectrogram-domain suppression.

#### Scenario: All three binaries are present in the test output directory after build

- **WHEN** `dotnet build -c Release` is run on any of the three reference platforms
- **THEN** the platform-appropriate native library file SHALL be present in `tests/OpenWSFZ.Ft8.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/` alongside the test assembly

#### Scenario: The platform-appropriate binary is present in the daemon publish output

- **WHEN** `dotnet publish -c Release -r <rid>` is run for `OpenWSFZ.Daemon`
- **THEN** the platform-appropriate native library file SHALL be present in the publish output directory alongside the daemon executable
