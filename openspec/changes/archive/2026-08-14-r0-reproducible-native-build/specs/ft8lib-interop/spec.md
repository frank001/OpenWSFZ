## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ABI self-test on first load

On the first call that triggers `NativeLibrary.Load`, `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL invoke a sentinel function (`ft8_lib_version_check`) that returns a known integer constant embedded at compile time in the shim. The expected constant SHALL be **`20260039`** (r0-reproducible-native-build: the shim is rebuilt from a fully vendored, version-controlled source tree with byte-identical decode behaviour to the prior `20260038` build — no ABI, struct layout, or decode-behaviour change; the constant is bumped purely so the startup ABI check catches a binary built from the old, unreproducible object-linking process; version history: 20260038 = g2-hash-table-sizing-and-candidate-passband (`HASH_TABLE_SIZE` 256→4096; candidate passband `[200,3000)`→`[140,3030)`, held pending Captain's re-sequencing ruling — only the hash-table-sizing half is shipped as of `20260038`), 20260031 = f-001-hashed-callsign-resolution, 20260030 = decoder-settings-page runtime-configurable OSD gate parameters, 20260029 = D-009 K_MIN_SCORE_PASS2 raised 1→10, 20260028 = D-009 OSD nhard gate, 20260025 = OSD fallback + 50-iter BP, 20260021 = H6 AP decode hiscall offset fix; ⚠️ the intermediate bumps between `20260032` and `20260037` are not documented here — out of scope for this change, tracked as a separate spec-sync backlog item, not backfilled retroactively). If the returned value does not match the expected constant, `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` with a message that names the library path and the mismatched version values. This requirement applies on all three reference platforms.

#### Scenario: Correct library passes the ABI self-test

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads the platform-appropriate `libft8` binary compiled from the committed shim source at `FT8_SHIM_VERSION = 20260039`
- **THEN** the version check SHALL pass silently and decode calls SHALL proceed normally

#### Scenario: Previous library (20260038) fails fast with a clear error

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads a `libft8` binary compiled at version `20260038` (g2-hash-table-sizing-and-candidate-passband)
- **THEN** `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` before any decode call is attempted, with a message identifying the library path and the version mismatch

#### Scenario: Previous library (20260030) fails fast with a clear error

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads a `libft8` binary compiled at version `20260030` (decoder-settings-page)
- **THEN** `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` before any decode call is attempted, with a message identifying the library path and the version mismatch

#### Scenario: Previous library (20260029) fails fast with a clear error

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads a `libft8` binary compiled at version `20260029` (D-009 K=10)
- **THEN** `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` before any decode call is attempted, with a message identifying the library path and the version mismatch

#### Scenario: Previous library (20260016) fails fast with a clear error

- **WHEN** `Ft8LibInterop` loads a `libft8` binary compiled at version `20260016` (fix-d006-cleanup)
- **THEN** `Ft8LibInterop` SHALL throw `InvalidOperationException` before any decode call is attempted, with a message identifying the library path and the version mismatch
